          <p class="">When numbers and figures come together to form a proper analysis, it is called quantitative
            research. It is
            majorly used to find patterns and averages, make predictions, and generalize results to a wider population.
            Quantitative research is widely used in understanding customer psychology and to get accurate marketing
            positioning.</p>

          <p>One Way Solution gives you in-depth research by making your result as authentic as possible. From digging
            in the correct numbers to presenting you with proper facts and figures, all the boxes are ticked under one
            umbrella.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center text-white">HOW DOES QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WORK?</h3>
        <p class="text-white">This approach is used when you want to create social awareness or generate knowledge about
          the ongoing situation. Unlike qualitative research, there is no room for opinions or decisions derived through
          debates. Here, numbers, data, and graphs play a major role.</p>
        <p class="text-white">Using advanced tools and having subject matter experts on board, One Way Solution helps to
          give you a narrower result by giving comprehensive solutions to all the pain points</p>

          <h3>Descriptive research</h3>
          <p>Here, analysis takes place to derive the current status of an identified variable. These research projects
            are designed to provide systematic information about a particular phenomenon. There are no assumptions
            involved in the beginning here, but it comes into the picture after collecting relevant data. The
            information is collected in a standardized manner and each unit is studied carefully to start the hypothesis
            of the project.</p>
          <p>Now, this method is majorly used to understand human behaviour in various situations. Some common examples
            of this could be how scientists feel about global warming, how fifth-grade students spend their time during
            summer vacations, how parents feel about the twelve-month school year, etc</p>
