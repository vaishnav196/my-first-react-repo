      <h3 className="text-white text-center bg-primary my-4 py-2">QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</h3>
      <p className="">Also known as primary research, qualitative analysis demands interaction and real-time data. This
        is the process of collating data that hasn’t been out there yet. Interviews, market research surveys,
        questionnaires, and more fall under qualitative or primary research.</p>

      <p>At Aspects Fieldwork & Research, we conduct market research that adds a distinctive aspect to your
        organization. From coordinating with industry professionals to subject matter experts, we love going an
        extra mile for you.</p>

    <h3 className="text-center text-white">HOW DOES QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WORK?</h3>
    <p className="text-white">This approach is used when you want to create social awareness or generate knowledge about
      the ongoing situation. Unlike qualitative research, there is no room for opinions or decisions derived through
      debates. Here, numbers, data, and graphs play a major role.</p>
    <p className="text-white">Using advanced tools and having subject matter experts on board, One Way Solution helps to
      give you a narrower result by giving comprehensive solutions to all the pain points</p>

    <h2 className=" text-center px-2 py-3 text-primary">ESSENTIALS OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</h2>
    <p>The essence of qualitative market research is in-depth interaction with potential customers and industry
      experts. Aspects Fieldwork & Research focuses on the essentials of the same to give you accurate analysis and
      results. This includes:</p>
    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>One-on-one Interviews</h3>
      <p>In-depth interaction with industry-savvy individuals to get a thorough knowledge and breakdown of the
        subject. This process involves us interacting through personal interviews, telephonic conversations,
        infacility, or in-clinic evaluation. This data will be provided to you on a real-time basis. At One Way
        Solutions, take pride in giving authentic data and agency-client confidentiality.</p>


    </div>




    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>Product Placements</h3>
      <p>A form of advertisement, product placement is an act of putting the branded product into a movie or a web
        series as a part of promoting the same. The movie/web series gets paid for the same. It leaves a remarkable
        impression on the viewers. This technique of market research is highly effective as it can influence
        theaudience indirectly. With the show, your brand is effortlessly etched in the audience's minds.</p>


    </div>




    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>Focus Group</h3>
      <p>Catering to every industry, One Way Solutions specializes in doing focused group interviews and research.
        We go to the absolute ground level to give you precise results that will help you in preparing a way
        forward. This small group consists of carefully selected people who discuss a given topic. This process is
        usually used to identify and explore how people think and behave, and throw light on why, what, and how
        questions</p>
      <p>Now, this method is majorly used to understand human behaviour in various situations. Some common examples
        of this could be how scientists feel about global warming, how fifth-grade students spend their time during
        summer vacations, how parents feel about the twelve-month school year, etc</p>

    </div>




    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>A technique used in user-centered interaction, usability testing is designed to evaluate a product by
        testing it on actual users. This is an irreplaceable practice since it gives direct input on how real users
        use the products. Strategic planning goes behind conducting usability testing. This involves recruiting
        real-time users, designing the tasks, running the sessions, and analyzing the insights.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>Shadow Shopping</h3>
      <p>Also known as ‘Mystery Shopping’, this is a process in which a person visits a physical store (bank,
        restaurant, retail store, etc) to measure the quality of customer experience. Some of the parameters for
        this study are:
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>How is the customer greeted</li>
        <li>What is the maximum acceptable waiting time</li>
        <li>How many products should be on the display</li>
        <li>How is the customer query addressed and solved</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Not only do we conduct regular audits for you, but we also interact with the audience to know their
        experience. This adds value to your research and acts as an important decision-making factor.</p>

    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>Online Bulletin Board</h3>
      <p>Remember the conventional bulletin board from your time in school that displayed a wide array of arts,
        crafts, important information, and more? This approach is pretty much similar to it.
      </p>
      <p>With a spin of modern-day advertising, an online bulletin board is a qualitative method of collating
        research by gathering people designed for the subject. The targeted people come under one roof to facilitate
        data production through comprehensive discussion among participants and a moderator. They read discussion
        transcripts, answer questions, post insights, and more.</p>

    </div>




    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>Consumer Connect</h3>

        industry caters to different audiences and niches. And to understand what the consumer wants in every
        different situation or season, this approach comes into play.
      </p>
      <p>Consumer behaviour, attitude, and belief systems have undergone a dramatic change, especially during the
        pandemic. Brands have been forced to evolve, while severalregular marketing practices have reversed. Staying
        relevant is all that matters and we help you do the same with exhaustive research by connecting with your
        targeted consumers</p>
    </div>


    <div className="col-md-6">
      <h3>Ethnographic Research</h3>
      <p>Not every research happens in a lab, some need a natural environment to give you an accurate result.
        Ethnographic research is a study to gain insights into how users interact with things in their natural
        environment. Qualitative research, this approach aims to provide an in-depth insight into the user’s views
        and actions along with the sights and sounds they encounter during the day.
      </p>


      <p>This includes direct observations, diary studies, video recordings, photography, and artifact analysis.
        Observations can be made from anywhere including the user's workplace, home, or even while they’re out with
        their friends and family.</p>

      <p>At One Way Solutions, we bring to you meaningful and informative user opinions to help you make decisions
        strategically</p>
